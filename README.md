## Features

Voicely is a loginless messaging and notekeeping app featuring speech-to-text, SMS capabilities, voice-activated emojis and punctuation, and local data storage.

* Built using Microsoft's Speech SDK.
* Light on dependencies. Uses Google Materialize, JQuery, and vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
* Responsive UI.
* Customizable theme colors.
* Just say "Voicely _____ symbol" or "Voicely _____ emoji" to dynamically replace the words you say with a corresponding symbol or emoji. Ex: "Voicely smiley face emoji" will remove the text "Voicely" and "emoji" and replace "smiley face" with a ðŸ™‚ symbol.
* Queries the Emoji API for a list of emojis for text replacement, but also maintains a stored copy.
* Uses the ClickSend API to send SMS messages to chosen phone numbers.
* Uses custom modals instead of alerts, prompts, or confirms.
* Voicely files are saved to localStorage, which populates a list to be retrieved at the user's leisure.
